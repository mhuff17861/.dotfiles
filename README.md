Note
--------
This repo was forked from [solsaver's repo](https://github.com/solsaver/dotfiles) so that I could make my own adjustments to
their setup. Solsaver gets the majority of the credit for what is in this repo, as I am merely building on top of it.

General
-------
My dotfiles, bootstrapped and automated with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). This repo is currently only setup for debian-based environments, and most of the installation scripting will fail on other machines. I plan on making it compatible for Arch eventually.

Installation
------------

To install, run the following:
```console
git clone https://github.com/mhuff17861/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles
./install
```
**Note:** You will need to restart your terminal for fzf to register as installed after the scripts run.
I don't currently have it setup to work for storing the repo wherever you want, but that is on the TODO list.
